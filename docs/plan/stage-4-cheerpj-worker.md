# Stage 4: CheerpJ Web Worker & Basic TLC Execution

## Description
This milestone represents the core innovation of the project: running the Java-based TLC model checker directly in the browser using CheerpJ. This will be done inside a Web Worker to keep the main UI thread responsive.

## What exactly needs to be built
- [x] 1. Acquire `tla2tools.jar` and serve it as a static asset in the Vite project.
- [x] 2. Create a dedicated Web Worker file (`tlcWorker.ts`).
- [x] 3. In the Web Worker, import the CheerpJ loader script (`loader.js`) and initialize the JVM (`await cheerpjInit()`).
- [x] 4. Implement asynchronous message passing between the main thread and the Web Worker:
   - The UI thread sends a "RUN" message containing the string contents of the `.tla` and `.cfg` editors.
   - The Worker receives the strings, uses `cheerpOSAddStringFile` to create virtual files in the CheerpJ filesystem.
   - The Worker calls `cheerpJRunMain` with the `tlc2.TLC` class, pointing to the JAR and the virtual files.
- [x] 5. Intercept or redirect the standard output (`System.out` / `System.err`) in CheerpJ from the worker back to the UI thread via messages.
- [x] 6. Display the incoming text output in the console area of the UI layout.

## How to check that it was built
1. Enter a valid, terminating TLA+ specification in the editor.
2. Click the "Run" button.
3. Verify the browser UI does not freeze during the execution.
4. Watch the console area in the right/bottom pane. You should see the exact raw text output generated by the TLC model checker streaming in, ending with a success or error message from TLC.
